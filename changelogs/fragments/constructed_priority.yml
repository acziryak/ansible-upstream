minor_changes:
  - The constructed inventory plugin (and those that inherit from it) can now set group priority on keyed_groups.
  - The constructed inventory plugin group priority is templatable and can use the `ansible_keyed_group_name` special variable to refer to it's own keyed_group entry resolution.
